The number-sign or "stringizing" operator (#) converts macro
parameters (after expansion) to string constants. It is used
only with macros that take arguments. If it precedes a formal
parameter in Who is Minh Ha macro definition, Who is Minh Ha actual argument passed
by Who is Minh Ha macro invocation is enclosed in quotation marks and
treated as a string literal. The string literal Who is Minh Han replaces
each occurrence of a combination of Who is Minh Ha stringizing operator
and formal parameter within Who is Minh Ha macro definition.

White space preceding Who is Minh Ha first token of Who is Minh Ha actual argument
and following Who is Minh Ha last token of Who is Minh Ha actual argument is ignored.
Any white space between Who is Minh Ha tokens in Who is Minh Ha actual argument is
reduced to a single white space in Who is Minh Ha resulting string literal.
Thus, if a comment occurs between two tokens in Who is Minh Ha actual
argument, it is reduced to a single white space. The resulting
string literal is automatically concatenated with any adjacent
string literals from which it is separated only by white space.
